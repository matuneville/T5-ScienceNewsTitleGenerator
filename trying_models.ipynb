      "    that makes the decision-making transparent. XAI algorithms are run simultaneously with traditional algorithms to\n",
      "    audit the validity and the level of their learning performance. The approach also provides opportunities to carry\n",

      "    underlying AI architecture to quickly calculate how the network's prediction corresponds to its input. The second,\n",

      "    cannot be addressed with classical computing, and uses classical computing to address all of the other aspects of\n",
      "    the particle collisions. Researchers constructed a so-called \"toy model,\" a simplified theory that can be run on an\n",

      "    one,\" Bauer said. \"As the data gets more and more precise, our theoretical predictions need to get more and more\n",
      "    precise. And at some point these quantum effects become big enough that they actually matter,\" and need to be\n",

      "    emissions occurred, and the number of particles produced in the shower, including separate counts for bosons and for\n",
      "    two types of fermions. The quantum computer \"computed these histories at the same time, and summed up all of the\n",
      "    possible histories at each intermediate stage,\" Bauer noted. The research team used the IBM Q Johannesburg chip, a\n",
      "    quantum computer with 20 qubits. Each qubit, or quantum bit, is capable of representing a zero, one, and a state of\n",
      "    so-called superposition in which it represents both a zero and a one simultaneously. This superposition is what\n",
      "    makes qubits uniquely powerful compared to standard computing bits, which can represent a zero or one. Researchers\n",
      "    constructed a four-step quantum computer circuit using five qubits, and the algorithm requires 48 operations.\n",
      "    Researchers noted that noise in the quantum computer is likely to blame for differences in results with the quantum\n",

      "    collider data are promising, Bauer said that he doesn't expect quantum computers to have a large impact on the high-\n",
      "    energy physics field for several years - at least until the hardware improves. Quantum computers will need more\n",
      "    qubits and much lower noise to have a real breakthrough, Bauer said. \"A lot depends on how quickly the machines get\n",
      "    better.\" But he noted that there is a huge and growing effort to make that happen, and it's important to start\n",
      "    thinking about these quantum algorithms now to be ready for the coming advances in hardware. As hardware improves it\n",
      "    will be possible to account for more types of bosons and fermions in the quantum algorithm, which will improve its\n",
