      "    which outperformed comparable approaches on industry benchmarks, was developed through an ongoing AI research\n",
      "    collaboration between LG and U of T that was expanded in 2019 with a focus on AI applications for businesses .\n",

      "    chance of having a tumour,\" says Sudhakar. \"The consequences of acting on inaccurate or biased information are\n",
      "    literally life or death. To fully understand and interpret the model's prediction, the doctor needs to know how the\n",
