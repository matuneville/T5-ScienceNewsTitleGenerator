      " TC Study Finds MOOC Reality Not Yet Meeting High Expectations\n",
      "Article:  \n",
      " The rollout of MOOCs, or massive open online courses, three years ago by some of the country's leading universities triggered predictions that bricks-and-mortar campuses would soon be obsolete and that learning would be forever changed.\n",
      "Well, maybe - but not any time soon, according to one of the first comprehensive studies of MOOCs from the perspective of institutions, just released by researchers at Teachers College. The study is based on 83 interviews with faculty members, administrators, researchers, and other actors in the MOOCspace from 62 institutions, mostly in the U.S. It includes 13 case studies to illustrate how MOOCs are successfully being used to address institutional goals.\n",
      "The study finds that a primary goal for institutions offering MOOCs is to extend institutional reach and access to education. \"MOOCs are providing educational opportunities to millions of individuals across the world,\" write Fiona M. Hollands (Ph.D. '03) and Devayani Tirthali (Ed.D. '13, Ed.M. '12), respectively of the College's Center for Benefit-Cost Studies of Education and Institute for Learning Technologies, in their report, \"MOOCs: Expectations and Reality.\" However, to date, \"most MOOC participants are already well-educated and employed.\" Consequently, \"the evidence suggests that MOOCs currently are falling far short of 'democratizing' education and may, for now, be doing more to increase gaps in access to education than to diminish them.\"\n",
      "Using MOOCs to \"build and maintain brand\" is another frequently mentioned institutional goal, but while MOOCs often generate media attention, \"isolating and measuring impact of any new initiative on brand is a difficult exercise,\" the report suggests. Indeed, increasing access to online offerings and enhancing brand may be contradictory goals, because the former can be seen as diminishing the selectiveness of the offering institution.\n",
      "Hollands and Tirthali report that it is still too early to know whether MOOCs can live up to the hype of providing a cost-effective means for producing better educational outcomes on a mass scale. Cost analyses of MOOC production and delivery at four different institutions found that costs ranged from $39,000 to $325,000 per MOOC. \"MOOCs have, so far, proved to be a significant drain on time and money for institutions,\" Hollands and Tirthali write. That picture could change as institutions reuse MOOC materials, share them with each other, develop common courses, replace on-campus courses with MOOCs, and save on faculty teaching time and facilities costs. Revenue streams from MOOCs have been slow in materializing. Unless costs of MOOC production can be recovered through fees, Hollands and Tirthali speculate that \"free, non-credit bearing MOOCs are likely to remain available only from the wealthiest institutions that can subsidize the costs from other sources of funds.\"\n",
      "As for improving learning outcomes, MOOCs, on the whole, cannot yet make that claim. \"While interviewees provided many examples of how MOOCs have been used to change instruction, for the most part, actual impact on educational outcomes has not been documented in any rigorous fashion,\" the report asserts. However, two cases highlighted in the report provide examples of positive effects on student performance as a result of adopting MOOC-inspired strategies such as frequent assessment and automatic feedback, or of integrating MOOCs into flipped on-campus courses. Hollands and Tirthali conclude that \"while the potential for MOOCs to contribute significantly to the development of personalized and adaptive learning is high, the reality is far from being achieved.\" To get there, \"a great deal of coordination and collaboration among content experts, instructors, researchers, instructional designers, and programmers will be necessary.\"\n",
      "Hollands and Tirthali make several recommendations to institutions for increasing the value of MOOCs to improve access and educational outcomes, and to reduce the costs of higher education. These include:\n",

The next milestone is to get them to do useful things. Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, have now shown that they can solve a small part of a real logistics problem with their small, but well-functioning quantum computer.\\nInterest in building quantum computers has gained considerable momentum in recent years, and feverish work is underway in many parts of the world. In 2019, Google\\'s research team made a major breakthrough when their quantum computer managed to solve a task far more quickly than the world\\'s best supercomputer. The downside is that the solved task had no practical use whatsoever - it was chosen because it was judged to be easy to solve for a quantum computer, yet very difficult for a conventional computer.\\nTherefore, an important task is now to find useful, relevant problems that are beyond the reach of ordinary computers, but which a relatively small quantum computer could solve.\\n\"We want to be sure that the quantum computer we are developing can help solve relevant problems early on. Therefore, we work in close collaboration with industrial companies,\" says theoretical physicist Giulia Ferrini, one of the leaders of Chalmers University of Technology\\'s quantum computer project, which began in 2018.\\nTogether with Göran Johansson, Giulia Ferrini led the theoretical work when a team of researchers at Chalmers, including an industrial doctoral student from the aviation logistics company Jeppesen, recently showed that a quantum computer can solve an instance of a real problem in the aviation industry.\\nThe algorithm proven on two qubits \\xad All airlines are faced with scheduling problems. For example, assigning individual aircraft to different routes represents an optimisation problem, one that grows very rapidly in size and complexity as the number of routes and aircraft increases.\\nResearchers hope that quantum computers will eventually be better at handling such problems than today\\'s computers. The basic building block of the quantum computer - the qubit - is based on completely different principles than the building blocks of today\\'s computers, allowing them to handle enormous amounts of information with relatively few qubits.\\nHowever, due to their different structure and function, quantum computers must be programmed in other ways than conventional computers. One proposed algorithm that is believed to be useful on early quantum computers is the so-called Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).\\nThe Chalmers research team has now successfully executed said algorithm on their quantum computer - a processor with two qubits - and they showed that it can successfully solve the problem of assigning aircraft to routes. In this first demonstration, the result could be easily verified as the scale was very small - it involved only two airplanes.\\nPotential to handle many aircraft With this feat, the researchers were first to show that the QAOA algorithm can solve the problem of assigning aircraft to routes in practice. They also managed to run the algorithm one level further than anyone before, an achievement that requires very good hardware and accurate control.\\n\"We have shown that we have the ability to map relevant problems onto our quantum processor. We still have a small number of qubits, but they work well. Our plan has been to first make everything work very well on a small scale, before scaling up,\" says Jonas Bylander, senior researcher responsible for the experimental design, and one of the leaders of the project of building a quantum computer at Chalmers.\\nThe theorists in the research team also simulated solving the same optimisation problem for up to 278 aircraft, which would require a quantum computer with 25 qubits.\\n\"The results remained good as we scaled up. This suggests that the QAOA algorithm has the potential to solve this type of problem at even larger scales,\" says Giulia Ferrini.\\nSurpassing today\\'s best computers would, however, require much larger devices. The researchers at Chalmers have now begun scaling up and are currently working with five quantum bits. The plan is to reach at least 20 qubits by 2021 while maintaining the high quality.\\nThe research results have been published in two articles in Physical Review Applied :\\nImproved Success Probability with Greater Circuit Depth for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and\\nApplying the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to the Tail-Assignment Problem\\nMore about: The Swedish quest for a quantum computer The research is part of the Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technology (WACQT), a twelve-year, billion-dollar investment with two main purposes: to develop Swedish expertise in quantum technology, and to build a useful quantum computer with at least one hundred quantum bits.

But a team of computer scientists have tackled one of the major challenges in VR that will greatly improve user experience--enabling an immersive virtual experience while being physically limited to one\\'s actual, real-world space. The research team will present their work at SIGGRAPH 2018.\\nComputer scientists from Stony Brook University, NVIDIA and Adobe have collaborated on a computational framework that gives VR users the perception of infinite walking in the virtual world--while limited to a small physical space. The framework also enables this free-walking experience for users without causing dizziness, shakiness, or discomfort typically tied to physical movement in VR. And, users avoid bumping into objects in the physical space while in the VR world.\\nTo do this, the researchers focused on manipulating a user\\'s walking direction by working with a basic natural phenomenon of the human eye, called saccade. Saccades are quick eye movements that occur when we look at a different point in our field of vision, like when scanning a room or viewing a painting. Saccades occur without our control and generally several times per second. During that time, our brains largely ignore visual input in a phenomenon known as \"saccadic suppression\"--leaving us completely oblivious to our temporary blindness, and the motion that our eyes performed.\\n\"In VR, we can display vast universes; however, the physical spaces in our homes and offices are much smaller,\" says lead author of the work, Qi Sun, a PhD student at Stony Brook University and former research intern at Adobe Research and NVIDIA. \"It\\'s the nature of the human eye to scan a scene by moving rapidly between points of fixation. We realized that if we rotate the virtual camera just slightly during saccades, we can redirect a user\\'s walking direction to simulate a larger walking space.\"\\nUsing a head- and eye-tracking VR headset, the researchers\\' new method detects saccadic suppression and redirects users during the resulting temporary blindness. When more redirection is required, researchers attempt to encourage saccades using a tailored version of subtle gaze direction--a method that can dynamically encourage saccades by creating points of contrast in our visual periphery.\\nThe team who authored the research, titled \"Towards Virtual Reality Infinite Walking: Dynamic Saccade Redirection,\" will present their work at SIGGRAPH 2018, held 12-16 August in Vancouver, British Columbia. The annual conference and exhibition showcases the world\\'s leading professionals, academics, and creative minds at the forefront of computer graphics and interactive techniques.\\nTo date, existing methods addressing infinite walking in VR have limited redirection capabilities or cause undesirable scene distortions; they have also been unable to avoid obstacles in the physical world, like desks and chairs. The team\\'s new method dynamically redirects the user away from these objects. The method runs fast, so it is able to avoid moving objects as well, such as other people in the same room.\\nThe researchers ran user studies and simulations to validate their new computational system, including having participants perform game-like search and retrieval tasks. Overall, virtual camera rotation was unnoticeable to users during episodes of saccadic suppression; they could not tell that they were being automatically redirected via camera manipulation. Additionally, in testing the team\\'s method for dynamic path planning in real-time, users were able to walk without running into walls and furniture, or moving objects like fellow VR users.\\n\"Currently in VR, it is still difficult to deliver a completely natural walking experience to VR users,\" says Sun. \"That is the primary motivation behind our work--to eliminate this constraint and enable fully immersive experiences in large virtual worlds.\"\\nThough mostly applicable to VR gaming, the new system could potentially be applied to other industries, including architectural design, education, and film production.\\n###\\nFor the full paper and video, visit the project page.
